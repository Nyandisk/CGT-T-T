# CGT-T-T
Completely Garbage Tic-Tac-Toe Game


Runs on Unity and PUN 2 (Free) For networking.
If you don't want to, you don't have to copy the asset folder photon stuff :), you can just get the package from asset store for yourself
It's actually one of my first networking based games on unity, meaning I'm still learning.
That's also the reason why some of the code is well.. spaghetti.


Only requirement if you decide to copy this entire repo, is to change the App-ID in 
**Assets/Photon/PhotonUnityNetworking/Resources/PhotonServerSettings.asset**
